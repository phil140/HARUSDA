A description of each of the fields contained in the dataset file "meanbysubjectactivity.txt" is given below.

These features are based on the features described in features_info.txt. Originally they came from "the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals
tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ" of the smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). The time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz and translated
to acceleration signals, and separated into body and gravity acceleration signals. Where '-XYZ' denotes 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The units of measure are unclear.
